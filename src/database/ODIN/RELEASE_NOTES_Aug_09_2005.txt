- Having problems with latest version of FSM reencoding
- Two of the benchmarks compile, but don't pass through Stratix
- Blif generation tested, but not completely verified.  Some
files don't seem to work with VPR (cause VPR to crash)
- 4 bugs have been fixed
- Xilinx support still not available.  Not sure if I will
do this
